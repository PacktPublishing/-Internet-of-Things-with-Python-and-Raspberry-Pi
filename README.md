# Internet of Things with Python and Raspberry Pi [Video]
This is the code repository for [	Internet of Things with Python and Raspberry Pi [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/internet-things-python-and-raspberry-pi-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Deploying an end-to-end IoT solution requires the development of smart devices, a reliable and real-time communication channel, and a responsive backend server. An efficient ecosystem first requires developing each component and then precise execution in a robust and foolproof way!

This course starts you off with IoT project development by combining Python and Raspberry Pi and lays a foundation from which you can develop complex real-world projects. You will learn to build a motion-detecting anti-theft device that sends real-time data to you remotely to signal intruder activity in your house. This course then teaches you to build an IoT server in Python-Flask, allowing your users to log in securely and access their devices. It is based on the publish and subscribe model, which assures authentic user database. You will learn synchronous and asynchronous encryption techniques and protocols that fortify your IoT system. . Finally, you will build an atmosphere monitoring system with the ability of energy saving functionality, using infrared sensors, motion sensors, and ADC. The system will alert and detect ambient atmospheric conditions.

By the end of the course, you will have built a secure ecosystem of interconnected devices that will upgrade your skills to build much complex projects using Python and Raspberry Pi in real-world scenarios!
